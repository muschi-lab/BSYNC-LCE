BSYNC-LCE
Bayesian SYNchronization of climate records with annual Layer-Counting Errors

BSYNC-LCE is a specialized implementation of BSYNC (Aquino-Lopez & Muschitiello, in prep.) developed for the automatic alignment of Greenland ice-core and speleothem climate records. It employs a probabilistic inversion model that incorporates prior knowledge of annual ice-layer counting uncertainty to estimate the age offset between the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) and the speleothem U–Th timescale. Since the older portion of the IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration curve is largely based on the speleothem timescale, synchronizing Greenland ice-core and speleothem data with BSYNC-LCE facilitates the integration of ice-core, U–Th-dated, and radiocarbon-dated paleoclimate records onto a unified chronological framework spanning the past 50,000 years.
